   <h3>Vinaigrette being poured onto a salad</h3>
   <p>The time has come for you to embrace homemade salad dressing — starting with this vinaigrette. You don’t need a recipe, and you don’t even really need measuring spoons — all you need is a basic understanding of how oil and vinegar work together. Here is everything you need to know.</p>
   <p>The most basic formula for making a salad vinaigrette is one part vinegar or other acid mixed with three to four parts oil. For instance, you could use one tablespoon of cider vinegar and three tablespoons of olive oil. Or you could make a big batch of dressing and use 1/4 cup of vinegar mixed with 3/4 cups olive oil. Or use ounces, or milliliters, or the side of a jam jar — this a ratio, so you can use the means of measuring the ingredients that you prefer.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><em>3/4 cup</em> Olive Oil</li>
        <li><em>1/4 cup</em> Lemon Juice</li>
        <li><em>1/2 tablespoon</em> Salt</li>
        <li><em>1/4 tablespoon</em> Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure all ingredients into a bowl, blender, or jar.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine the vinaigrette:</strong> If using a bowl, use a fork or whisk to rapidly blend the vinaigrette together. If using a jar, top with the lid and shake until the vinaigrette is combined. If using a blender, blend until the vinaigrette is thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li><strong> the vinaigrette:</strong> Dip a leaf of salad into the vinaigrette and give it a taste; tasting the dressing with the greens gives you a better idea of how the vinaigrette will taste with a salad than if you taste it on its own.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the taste:</strong> Add more olive oil for a more mellow flavor, more vinegar or lemon juice for more tartness, and more of any of the other ingredients to taste. Whisk, shake, or blend to combine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use the vinaigrette</strong>: For a side salad for 2 to 4, start with a tablespoon of dressing, toss, and continue adding until the greens are evenly coated and look glossy. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Store the vinaigrette:</strong> Transfer leftover vinaigrette to a jar or other container with a lid (if it's not already in a jar). If the vinaigrette contains any fresh ingredients, like lemon juice or minced shallots, store it in the fridge. Vinaigrettes will keep for 3 to 5 days; shake to recombine the vinaigrette before using.</li>
    </ol>
