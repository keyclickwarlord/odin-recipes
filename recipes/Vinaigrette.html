   <h3>Vinaigrette being poured onto a salad</h3>
   <p>The time has come for you to embrace homemade salad dressing — starting with this vinaigrette. You don’t need a recipe, and you don’t even really need measuring spoons — all you need is a basic understanding of how oil and vinegar work together. Here is everything you need to know.</p>
   <p>The most basic formula for making a salad vinaigrette is one part vinegar or other acid mixed with three to four parts oil. For instance, you could use one tablespoon of cider vinegar and three tablespoons of olive oil. Or you could make a big batch of dressing and use 1/4 cup of vinegar mixed with 3/4 cups olive oil. Or use ounces, or milliliters, or the side of a jam jar — this a ratio, so you can use the means of measuring the ingredients that you prefer.</p>
